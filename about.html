<p>My name is Ryan Woodard and 2018 is the year I transition into a career in Tech.  I was first introduced to the web back in 1996 and have seen the incredible advances in the way information and people have organized in a premobile and now mobile world.  My ultimate goal is to provide my insights and personal experiences to help shape  positive impacts in the technology available at the tips of our fingers.  The pen was mightier than the sword and the keyboard has proven to continue this adage in ways we continue to imagine.</p>
